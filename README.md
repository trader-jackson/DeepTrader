A PyTorch implementation of the paper ["DeepTrader: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Risk-Return Balanced Portfolio Management with Market Conditions Embedding"](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/16731) (AAAI 2021).

![DeepTrader Architecture](https://i.imgur.com/placeholder.png)

## üìã Overview

DeepTrader is a deep reinforcement learning framework for portfolio management that effectively balances risk and return. The model consists of two complementary units:

- **Asset Scoring Unit**: Ranks individual stocks based on their future price movement potential
- **Market Scoring Unit**: Dynamically adjusts the long/short ratio based on market conditions

What makes DeepTrader unique is its ability to capture both temporal and spatial dependencies between assets through different graph structures, with causal structure providing the best performance.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- üìà Deep RL-based portfolio management with both long and short positions
- üõ°Ô∏è Risk-return balanced strategy with maximum drawdown control
- üîÑ Dynamic adjustment to market conditions 
- üåê Graph-based modeling of stock relationships (industry, correlation, partial correlation, causal)
- üìä Comprehensive evaluation metrics and visualization tools
- üß™ Implementation for multiple stock indices (Dow 30, NASDAQ 100, SSE 50)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deeptrader.git
cd deeptrader

# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Download Data

```bash
# Download Dow Jones 30 data
python main.py train --dataset dow30 --download --num-epochs 1
```

### Train the Model

```bash
# Train DeepTrader using causal graph structure
python main.py train --dataset dow30 --graph-type causal --reward-type mdd --num-epochs 100
```

### Evaluate Model Performance

```bash
# Evaluate against baseline strategies
python main.py evaluate --dataset dow30 --model-path ./path/to/model.pth --baselines
```

## üìä Performance Metrics

The model's performance is evaluated using comprehensive financial metrics:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **ARR** | Annual Rate of Return |
| **AVol** | Annual Volatility |
| **ASR** | Annualized Sharpe Ratio |
| **SoR** | Sortino Ratio |
| **MDD** | Maximum Drawdown |
| **CR** | Calmar Ratio |

## üîç Experimental Results

According to the original paper and our implementation:

1. **Graph Structures**: Causal > Partial Correlation > Industry > Correlation
2. **Market Conditions**: The market scoring unit significantly improved risk-adjusted performance
3. **Crisis Performance**: DeepTrader showed superior robustness during market downturns
